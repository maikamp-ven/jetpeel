    "text1": "The  <a href=\"/jetPeel\">JetPeel™</a> - hydroporation technology uses specially designed and patented JetPeel™ handpieces, which are fully adapted to the unique jet pressure mechanism. The nozzles of the handpieces must withstand extremely high pressure and liquid jet speed, which can reach up to <b>200 m/s</b> (720 km/h).<br/> A specially designed nozzle disperses the accelerated liquid jets into micro-droplets, which are gently absorbed into the skin. The power of the jet stream stretches the skin painlessly, opening microchannels deep into the dermis. The procedure does not require needles, incisions, or break the skin's surface.",
    "text2": "The <a href=\"/jetPeel\">JetPeel™</a> - handpiece's direct transepidermal delivery mechanism ensures that the results are immediately visible and effective on the same day. JetPeel™ offers handpieces with different nozzle sizes and configurations, making them suitable for a variety of aesthetic treatments.<br/><a href=\"/jetPeel\">JetPeel™ </a> The handpiece is the key to JetPeel technology's effectiveness, as it enables precise and comfortable jet stream delivery into the skin layers. Only original TavTech JetPeel™ handpieces are approved for use in JetPeel™ treatments."
